what is source control doing when not linked to git hub? accidently delete project with it (better now than later).


practice using api - do in two ways (1 using js fetch method (a using async await, b promises), 2 use library axios)
import json into react Component

redo create-react-app find flag to make it typescript project

.jsx for react files

why is DOM manipulation bad? async related?

TS interface/ type
